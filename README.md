# Car-Booking-System
- my first website ;)

The Car Booking System is a software application allowing customers to rent vehicles for a specific period. The system caters to both the customers and the admin. The Admin is responsible for managing the vehicles in the system and performing administrative tasks. They can use the system to add new vehicles to the system, modify details of existing vehicles like the model, year, type and other details, delete vehicles from the system, search for bookings based on various criteria like vehicle model and booking id, filtering the search booking based on booking status, amend or reject reservations and view the dashboard which provides information about the vehicle inventory and booking information. The dashboard displays the vehicle's inventory and booking information.
For the customer, they can use the system to make a reservation for a car of their choice, view current and previous reservations, search for bookings based on various criteria like vehicle model and booking id, modify their reservations by changing the date, time, or vehicle type, cancel reservations if they change their mind and edit their profile information like name, contact number, etc.
